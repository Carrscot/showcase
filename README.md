# showcase

This will be a show case of all projects I have done for The Odin project courses.

The general design of the main page will be very basic with some interactive elemetns which can be expanded upon as I learn more interesting styles, animations etc.

MAIN PAGE:

	Heading

	Short description

	Large centered boxes which contain the title of the project. Below each box will be a very brief description of the project.
		>>>Each box will be coloured the same as the project page and the border will be "highlighted" and expand upon mouseover.
		>>>Upon clicking the box the page will changed into the linked project.
